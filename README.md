# MobileComputingSS20 | Group 5 | Neighbour in need! | Android Application

In times of the Coronavirus we thought about implementing an application, which helps people to find/offer help/things to others in their neighbourhood. The name of the app will be "Neighbour in Need", we worked on the concept together.

![Test Image](https://github.com/MarosiF/NeighbourInNeed/tree/master/prototype/NeighbourInNeed_P1.png)

Our main functions are:
1. Every user can create a profile, which includes name, address, phone number, E-Mail ...
2. As a registrated user you can create an advertisement. We thought about two main categories: "Search for help" and "Offer help". In this category you can choose between three subcategories: "Give something for free", "Borrow/Lend something", "Offer help" e.g. doing the shopping
As an advertiser you can choose between three options:

- The customer has to pick up the stuff from the advertiser's place
- The advertiser will ship it out via post
- The advertiser will bring the stuff to the customer

Potential use cases might be:
Use case 1: Borrow/lend something
Someone wants to lend a lawnmower
Use case 2: Give something for free
Someone has sewed masks and wants to gift it to the public

3. Furthermore there will be a rating system, where users can rate and write comments about other users, after they interacted with each other.

Nice-to-have functions (just in case we have time left):
- Chatfunction
- Geolocation, in order to verify the address at the very beginning of the registration
- All the legally basics etc.

The database used for this project is the xy [TODO].
